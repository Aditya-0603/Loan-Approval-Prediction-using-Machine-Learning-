# 💳 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to repay or default using machine learning techniques. In the banking sector, loan approval is a critical decision because incorrect approvals can increase credit risk and lead to financial losses. This project builds a data-driven solution to support better and faster loan approval decisions.

The project follows an end-to-end workflow including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web application.

# 🎯 Business Objective

Banks earn a large portion of their revenue through loans but face the risk of customer default, known as credit risk. By predicting loan default in advance, banks can reduce non-performing assets and improve decision-making. This project aims to build a predictive system that helps identify reliable loan applicants.
